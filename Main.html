     <p>This letter is to inform you of the plans for this school years Behind-the-Wheel training sessions.</p>
     <p>Your teen will have six two-hour sessions of behind the wheel with the instructor. The pick-up locations for the
      in-car sessions will depend on the day the session is scheduled. If school is in session (a scheduled school
      day), we will pick your teen up at the designated location noted below</p>
     </div class="pickup">
      <p>VERONA PICKUP<br><mark>in front of the KWIK TRIP gas station Verona 233 Wildcat Way</mark><br>
        <p> MEMORIAL PICKUP</p>at the<mark><em>the Memorial Min. Pt. Rd. exit (nearest the nurse’s office.)</em></mark><br>
        <p>On Saturdays, Sundays, or days when school is not in session, unless informed otherwise by Jim of
            Mad-Area</p>, we will pick your teen up and drop them off two hours later front of the KWIK TRIP gas station in Verona 233 Wildcat Way. 
        </p>

        <div class="Behavior Policy">
        <h1>BEHAVIOR POLICY</h1>
        <article>In Wisconsin, students are granted a permit at 15, and a probationary license at 16 years of age. At these
            ages, the State feels, students should understand the responsibilities associated with the privilege of driving.
            Therefore, we will dismiss any student from our program for repetitive disruptive behavior.
            • The first incident of disruptive in class, or in car behavior, will be handled by a discussion of the event
            with parents
            • If a second disruptive behavior incident occurs, the student will be dismissed from class without a
            refund and will not be allowed to return for six months.
            We expect classroom and in car instruction to be a good learning environment for all students, which is why
            we must adhere to a strict policy to promote this atmosphere.
            Each student is teamed with another, therefore if your teen does not keep his/her appointment the instructor
            and your teens driving partner will be greatly inconvenienced. To help eliminate any unnecessary last minute
            appointment changes or misses, $30.00 will be charged for each missed or unexcused appointment. If
            an appointment is missed the $30.00 fee must be paid at the student’s next lesson. Any changes in scheduled
            appointments will not be considered unless made at least 48 hours in advance to fill the requested
            appointment change.
            For driver education to have a lasting impact, it has to affect the behavior and attitude of the novice driver
            well beyond the duration of this course. That can only happen when students, parents and instructors
            combine their efforts and become partners to make driving safety a priority. As driver education instructors,
            my staff and I are trained to provide the foundation of safe driving. As the driver education parent or guardian,
            you play a key role in guiding your teenager through additional practice so he/she will become a good,
            responsible and safe driver.</article>

            <div class="CDC guidelines">
  
            <p><mark>We recognize that in order to be successful in school, your child needs support from both home and school. </mark><br>We know a strong partnership with you is vital for flexibility; this global pandemic present challenges that change on a daily basis. As partners, our shared responsibility for your child's safety and success will be guided by the following.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Strict adherence to CDC guidelines and safety protocols therefore more than two thirds of our students will remain on remote instruction.</li>
    <li>Non-employees will not be allowed in the school</li>
    <li>No student or employee can enter the school if exhibiting COVID symptoms</li>
    <li>No student or employee can enter the building without a mask</li>
    <li>Students and employees must provide their own masks and water</li>
    <li>Students and staff will have specific entrances that they must enter the building after being screened</li>
